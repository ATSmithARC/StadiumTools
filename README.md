# StadiumTools
This repo contains source code for a C# library + Grasshopper Assembly meant to aid in the cross-platform parametric modeling and analysis of Sports stadia geometries and related BIM elements.

Other tools exist for generating this type of geometry, but none that I know of are Open Sourced and utilized as a Grasshopper plugin.
